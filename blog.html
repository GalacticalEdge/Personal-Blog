            <h1>Testing my laptop - June 18, 2022</h1>
            <p>I am going out with my mom right now to go around and testing my new laptop. Right now I am going to Denny's to try it out.</p>
            <p>Line was unfortunately long, so we decided to go to McDonalds instead. sadly we will be there by 11 AM, so breakfast will be gone. We got to McDonalds and I happened to get a spam call saying there were "suspicious activities with my PayPal account". It was voicemail, so nothing could really be done. I ordered to small hamburgers at McDonalds and I had a good brunch.</p>
            <p>We are now going to the Arboretum to go out on a walk and observe nature. Because there place where a train station used to stand, I decided to visit and to my surprise, it was open. I learned about the history of the place and I found it interesting. I went to take a walk around the nature and now I am resting on a bench where I can look at the wonderful nature. We bought a few drinks and sat at a bench. A peacock happened to walk up to us, which was nice since it was a while since the last time they did it. We wanted to go see a movie afterwards, but my mom has a soccer game to watch, so we will go later.</p>
